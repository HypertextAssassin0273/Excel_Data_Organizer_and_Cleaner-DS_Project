Notes:
1. seperate each string/cell-entry with comma (,).
2. first string/cell-entry will be the colomn name.
3. if a cell contains multiple commas (,) then, use quotes ("") & type string in b/w those quotes. (i.e. "Hi, how r u?")
4. if a cell contains quotes ("") then do as follows:
	A) use quotes ("") & type string in b/w those quotes.
	B) wherever the multiple quotes are used in the string, use double quotes at the beginning & ending of that quoted text.
