  <ul>
    <li>Situations in which we handle large amounts of information, data cleansing is a must as it properly organizes the data, making algorithms easier to implement and run. So, if we have a well-cleaned dataset, we can get desired results even with a very simple algorithm, which can prove very beneficial at times.</li>
    <li>Data cleaning is the process consisting of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.
  The Data will be collected from any website e.g., Kaggle, which contain data-sets in .csv format, and after cleansing, it will be stored in separate .csv file.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>The Data will be collected from any website e.g., Kaggle, which contain data-sets in .csv format, and after cleansing, it will be stored in separate .csv file.</li>
    <li>Provides ideal solution that is able to cleanse any type of data.</li>
    <li>Two level based Cleaning (i.e. first simply parses the file in clean format & 2nd level deals with null values & outliers)</li>
    <li>Data is handled efficiently by saving in appropriate structure</li>
    <li>Move Semantics are used with dynamic Array structures in order to avoid using heavy node structures like doubly-linked list</li>
  </ul>
