  <summary style="color:#159957;font-size:2em;">Introduction</summary>
  <p>This project is based on the idea of an offline store management application which will handle shopping items in terms of categories. Our project has two main modules (i.e. Retailer & Customer), in which we have provided unique functionalities. We’ve also prioritized the application in terms of a GUI environment (by providing 2 diff. menu outlooks) so that it ensures a good interaction between the retailer/customer and the application with complete checkout process.<br><br>Hence, catering all the requirements of both Retailer & customer with an ensured smooth experience.</p>

  <summary style="color:#159957;font-size:2em;">Salient Features</summary>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>We have provided maximum abstraction so that the customer's data cannot be stolen/updated from app nor from its Files.</li>
    <li>We also ensured that all sensitive data is encrypted so that no info could be stole from files.</li>
    <li>The Code is in generalized format utilizing all C++ templates techniques, & variadic template function & Parameter pack (i.e. C++11 features).</li>
    <li>Our Project is capable of generating new Categories (i.e. Classes)
    At run-time, with up to 30 attributes.</li>
    <li>Our Application is portable, as it doesn’t require manual recompilation for generating new classes.
</li>
    <li>All Input data errors are validated using the generic function & its overloaded versions.</li>
    <li>Our application is also memory efficient (i.e. vector class approach used for Items Pointer Array).</li>
  </ul>
